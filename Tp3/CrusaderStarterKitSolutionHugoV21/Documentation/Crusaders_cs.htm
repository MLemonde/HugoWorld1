    Welcome to the Upgrade your Game series of tutorials. There will be 3 tutorials
    each covering writing a simple computer game using Visual Studio Express products.
    Though the games are simple, each one will teach some game development techniques
    and each will build on the last to improve your skills. The skills can be applied
    to more complex games including 3D games using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/">
        Microsoft DirectX</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Not all games are real time action games. Role playing games (RPGs) are generally slower paced with more thinking and usally no penalty if you turn your attention
        to something else for a few moments. Many, many, many years ago, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_%28computer_game%29">
            sometime in the 1970s</a> RPGs were played using text or graphics made up from
        text. Since this is not the 1970s we can do a little better than that using the
        sprites from the previous games.</p>
    <p>
        For the third and final game I will be creating a tile based role playing game.
        These days role playing games have as good graphics and special effects as any first
        person shooter. But the origins of graphical role playing games are tile based games
        like the early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI">Final Fantasy</a>
        and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima">Ultima</a> games. Since this is
        a beginner series with limited code I cannot create
        even games as complex as those
        early works, however I can give you most of the techniques you will need to put
        together similar looking games. After that its really just up to your imagination.</p>

    <h3>
        Tile based
        Games</h3>
    <p>
        Tile based games get their name from the way the graphics are built up. Instead
        of having a single graphic for each area in the game the area is built up from
        several small tiles. So there is a tile for grass, another with a tree and another
        with a brick wall. By combining these squares like a patchwork quilt you can make
        a huge number of different looking levels from a small number of graphics. Take
        a look at the <strong>tiles.bmp </strong>in the <strong>GameData folder</strong>
        for an idea what the tiles look like for this game.</p>
    <p>
        For this game I asked the artist to cover 3 themes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Outdoor - grass, trees and paths</li>
        <li>Castles - walls, floor and decorations</li>
        <li>Dungeon - different walls and floor</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For the paths I asked him to create all the sections needed to make paths that connect
        in any direction. This means there are 11 different combinations for each one. In addition he
			created 3 doors of differing colors with both open and closed positions.
        The doors are themed to fit into the castle wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will also see that this file also includes tiles for all of the in game objects. These are not drawn as 
        part of the tile based background but instead are layered
        over the top of the tiles depending on
        the location of the item in the game.</p>

    <h3>
        Extracting sprites and animation from sprite sheets</h3>
    <p>
        Its far more efficient to load all of the graphics in one go rather then having
        many different files as I did in Space Blitz. As you have already seen the graphics
        for this game are all in one file. Well actually they are in two. I asked the artist
        to put the multiframe animations in a second file so that we could control the layout
        without having to fit them around the other tiles. Take a look at <strong>animations.bmp</strong>
        if you are interested.</p>
    <p>
        The sprite class currently loads its own bitmap given a file name which is not really
        very efficient either - in Space Blitz you loaded the same bitmap multiple times
        each time it was used. To improve this I added a constructor that takes an already
        loaded bitmap and just stores the reference to it.
        Now multiple sprites can
share the same bitmap. This doesn't make sense for sprites that you want to change like
        to bases in Space Blitz but those are the exception to the rule.</p>
    <p>
        So how does the Sprite know which bit of the large bitmap it should draw? In the
        same constructor you pass a Rectangle structure that describes the top, left, height
        and width of the region you wish to extract. When the sprite is drawn it uses this
        to draw only the relevant part. The function also takes the number of frames of
        animation within that rectangle and automatically subdivides the rectangles to extract
        the correct frame into the _frames collection</p>

    <h3>
        Using color key to make sprites transparent</h3>
    <p>
        If the game objects were drawn over the top of the tiles in the same way that all
        of the other sprites are drawn they would look like this:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/CrusaderWrong.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        In Space Blitz all of the aliens were actually being drawn inside a black box (try
        changing the form background color and running the game). Since the game background
        was black you could not see this. That was fine for Space Blitz but is obviously
        not suitable for Crusader. The technique used is called Color Key and is the same
        one used in movies to put actors in front of a green screen into a sci-fi setting.
        Its more often called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key">chroma key</a>.
        The general idea is that you do not draw a pixel where it is a certain color. I
        requested the artist choose an RGB color that he was not using in the artwork and
        set the backgrounds to that color. He chose (75, 75, 75) which is the dark grey
        you see in the image above. When you ask GDI to draw the shape you tell it which
        color to remove and all the magic is done for you giving this corrected image:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/CrusaderRight.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The code is just a few lines of modification to the sprite drawing routine. _colorKey
        is Color.ToArgb(75, 75, 75).</p>
        <div class="codeblock">

    <h3>
        Data Driven Map Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        Describing what goes where in a game like this makes much more sense to be in a
        data file than inside the code. This means that some aspects of the game are very
        easy for you to change without even recompiling.</p>
    <p>
        There are 2 data files that drive most of the look and feel of the game. Things like
        how the doors open, how the monsters fight and what happens when you pick things
        up are, for this sample, hard coded in the code. But there's no reason why you couldn't
        change the data files to make them even more descriptive and then drive the game
        from the new files. You will be able to debate file formats and how they are laid
        out forever, so find something that works for your game and stick to it. To keep
        down the amount of code there error checking is minimal. For a game that is deigned
        to be modded by the end users this is something that would have to be improved.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Tilelookups.csv</span></strong></p>
    <p>
        This file describes all of the tiles and sprites in the game. Its a comma delimited
        format that contains the following information:</p>
    <p>
        Name: text name of the item</p>
    <p>
        Shortcut: an abbreviated lookup. This value must be unique and for background tiles
        must be a single character</p>
    <p>
        Path to bitmap: which bitmap this tile comes from</p>
    <p>
        X: the x count into the tile sheet. 1 is the 1st column. Assumes that the tiles
        are all the same size.</p>
    <p>
        Y: the y count into the tile sheet. 1 is the 1st row. Assumes that the tiles are
        all the same size.</p>
    <p>
        Transparent: Y or N (not case sensitive). if Y the (75, 75, 75) will be color keyed
        out.</p>
    <p>
        Number of Frames: How many frames of animation. The frames must be laid out from
        left to right with X,Y being frame 0</p>
    <p>
        Traversable: Open or Block (not case sensitive). If Block then the hero cannot pass.</p>
    <p>
        Special: For doors and keys this is the color, for characters is is the default

    <h3>
        Character Development and Game Play</h3>
    <p>
        One thing that distinguishes RPGs from other kinds of games is that usually the story
        is very relevant to the plot rather than being a poor excuse for why the character
        is about to do something very unlikely. In addition you usually take the character
        from a low start point to some high point in the game by changing or improving the
        way that character works. Different games call them different things but you have
        probably heard of games with levels, hit points, strength, agility and many more.
        The more advanced the game gets the more of these there are to track and the more
        effect they have in different parts of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the limited space for these games I chose to have a very simple, but often
        heard, story. The princess has been captured by the forces of evil (in this case
        a wizard since that's what the artist drew) and it is your job to rescue her. The
        story plays plays out in 3 settings: an outdoor area, a dungeon and a castle and
        each has a distinct look and type of monster to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
        The characters attributes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>health, which should stay above 0 and are replenished by food items</li>
        <li>experience, which is earned by killing monsters and gives attack and armour bonuses
            at certain levels</li>
        <li>attack rating - increases your damage and ability to hit</li>
        <li>armour rating - decreases the ability of others to hit you</li>
        <li>potions - each potion does damage to all visible monsters</li>
        <li>keys - which ones are you holding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All of these attributes and the code to manipulate them can be found in the GameState
        or the World classes. There is too much to list here but spend some time looking
        through to see how the world works. Searching for 'Health' for example will show
        you all the places that the health points are increased or decreased.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Since most of the game is data driven open up the maps in notepad and make some
            of your own </li>
        <li>Change all of the graphics to make a space themed game </li>
 
    <li>Game too hard or too easy? Change the rules of the game in the code. Give each monster
        its own attack and armour rating. Let the monsters attack back with magic.&nbsp;</li><li>Make the monsters move toward you. You should be able to reuse some of the
      hero animation code but you will need to implement some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding">
          path finding algorithms</a> to avoid obstacles.</li></ul>
