<p>
    No matter how hard you try when programming games you have to start using math.
    The simpler the game, the less math there is to learn and 2d games have simpler
    math but you cannot avoid it. The top selling 3d games of today are full of 3d vector
    math and complex simulations of physics. Fortunately you do not need to know all
    of that for the simple games presented in this series.</p>
    <p>
        This 2D primer covers some of the fundamentals of simple math needed
        for the 3 games
        in the Upgrade Your Game series for the Visual Studio Express products.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This documentation assumes that you have a basic knowledge of programming
 concepts and the Visual C# environment. You can learn more about these topics in the product documentation
 by clicking <b>Help</b> on the Main Menu, and selecting <b>Contents</b>, <b>Index</b>, or <b>Search</b>. You can also access Help by 
 positioning the mouse cursor on language keywords or user interface elements such as windows
 or dialog boxes, and pressing <b>F1</b>.</p>

    <h3>
        The Game Loop</h3>
    <p>
        Window Forms and ASP applications are often called event driven applications - they
        sit doing nothing for most of the time waiting for an external stimulus from an
        end user or another application with a button press or a web service request. This
        works really well for that kind of application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Games on the other hand are generally not sitting doing nothing all the time. Even
        if the end user is not pressing a key or a button on the gamepad the game must animate
        characters, perform AI functions, play sounds and many other things depending on
        the game. You've probably done some of these background type tasks in Windows Forms
        applications using Timer controls or background threads but in general these don't
        scale to the computer game scenario where there are multiple animations and multiple
        background tasks all happening at very different time intervals.</p>
    <p>
        The solution that most games use (and by most games I mean everything right up to
        the top selling Xbox 360 titles) is usually called 'The game loop'. In pseudo code
        it looks something like this:</p>
    <pre>
    While (game is running)
        Check for input
        Update all objects in the game 
        Draw all objects in the game</pre>
    <p>
        This might explain to you one reason why games almost always use 100% of your CPU
        even if they don't appear to be doing much. The faster your computer is the faster
        this loop will run and the smoother the animation and the synchronisation will be.</p>
    <p>
        There is one slight problem with running a tight loop like that at least under windows.
        If you don't allow Windows to check for and process windows messages and events
        then your application will be marked as 'Not responding' by the operating system.
        You may have seen this in your applications if you have a loop that runs for a long
        time. You may also have solved it by putting a call to DoEvents into the loop which
        allows windows to process the events. This can work reasonably well if you know
        the loop will end eventually but in this case the loop is the entire game so you
        need a better way.</p>
    <p>
        The method I have chosen to use for these games is NOT the most efficient way (for
        a full discussion on this under Managed DirectX see the <a href="http://www.thezbuffer.com/articles/185.aspx">
            MDX Game Loop FAQ</a>) but it is the simplest way to implement and none of the
        games covered here need the more complex, but efficient, method.</p>

    <h3>
        Sprites</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29">Sprites</a>
        are 2 dimensional images that appear in a video game. Sometimes they are static
        images but in general they are the building blocks for animation. They either move
        around the screen or change the image at regular intervals giving a 'flip book'
        kind of animation or they do both giving you characters like Mario and Donkey Kong
        that can move around the screen running and jumping.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Positioning a Sprite</h3>
    <p>
        Just like Windows Forms controls sprites are placed at an x,y position on the form.
        0,0 is the top left and ClientSize.Width, ClientSize.Height is the bottom right.
        Just like a Windows Forms control sprites have a height and width too.</p>
    <p>
        However unlike Windows Forms controls sprites are primarily designed to move and
        animate,
often hundreds of times per second to get the smoothest animation possible.
        So while a sprite can only be drawn at an integer x,y position its ACTUAL position
        at a sub second point in time could actually be 1.45, 12.67 and its important to
        remember this position so that the animation doesn't get choppy. So a sprite position
        is stored using a floating point Point structure PointF rather than the integer
        based Point structure like Windows Forms controls. This means
        we can store the sub pixel accuracy and then just convert to integer screen positions
        when we draw them.</p>
    <h3>
        Vectors</h3>
    <p>
        As you do more game programming you will come across the term vector a lot.
    Though its avoided in this series for simplicity the concepts are used when the positions
        of the sprites are updated for animation.</p>
    <p>
        Simply put a vector is just an offset. So a vector of (4,2) means that from some
        start point move 4 units in the x axis and 2 in the y axis.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will see positions referred to as a vector. In this case a position of (4,2)
        means an offset of (4,2) from the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/primer_position.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Vectors can be added together. So (4,2) + (2,4) gives you a total offset of (6,6).
    </p>
    <p>
        Vectors can have negative components so (-2,1) means move 2 units to the left on
        the x axis and one unit down on the y axis</p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/primer_vector.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        All of these concepts are used when moving a sprite around the screen.</p>
    <h3>
        Moving a Sprite</h3>
    <p>
        Sprites move with a certain VELOCITY. Velocity is different from speed because velocity
        also contains information about the direction. For example you can tell me you are
        driving at 60mph and I would guess that in one hour you would be 60 miles from the
        start point. But if you were driving round in a circle that would not be the case.
        If I told you my velocity was 60mph due East then I would know for sure where you
        would end up.</p>
    <p>
        Since our position is an x, y value we can store our velocity as another 2 component
        vector (s, t). s is how fast we want to move on the x axis and t is how fast we
        want to move on the y axis. If we add them together: (x,y) + (s,t) = (x+s, y+t)
        then we get the new position of the sprite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example:</p>
    <p>
        Sprite is at (4,10) and has a speed of (1,0). (1,0) means the sprite will move right
        in the x direction only. (4,10) + (1,0)&nbsp; = (5,10). If we repeat this addition 
        every second then the sprite will move 1 pixel per second across the screen. You
        can see that any direction and speed can be represented just by changing the s,
        t values in that vector.</p>
    <h3>
        Time Based Animation</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine a sprite that starts at X=0 and is moving to the right with a velocity of
        +10. If you walk through the game loop above the sprite would have +10 added to
        its position each time the sprite was updated and would move from X=0 to X={some
        bigger number} where {some bigger number} is 10 times the number of times the loop
        has been run. But the question is exactly how fast would it move? Well it depends
        on how fast the loop runs which depends on how fast your computer is running. This
        would mean that on your top of the line gaming rig the sprite could cross the screen
        in half a second, but on your parents 4 year old 'we only use it for email' computer
        it could take 2 seconds. Obviously this isn't something that is desirable in a computer
        game.</p>
    <p>
        To fix this you need to think about what velocity really is. What does that +10
        mean? Velocity is really a measure of distance over a period of time so you cannot
        think of the +1 as just a distance; it's really +1 pixel in some time that you need
        to define. So each time round the loop we just need to know how long it's been since
        the last update and scale the movement by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sprite that has a velocity of +10 actually means we move +10 pixels per second.
        So if it's been half a second since the last frame we multiply that by the velocity and move
        5 pixels. In reality the time between frames is fractions of a second.
        So on your fast gaming rig where the
        loop runs very fast the sprite will move with sub pixel accuracy for some very smooth
        animation. On your parents computer where the loop only runs 5 times per second
        the sprite will move 2 pixels each frame but after 10 seconds the sprite will be
        in exactly the same place as it is on your computer.</p>
    <p>
        The code will look something like this: (notice that for accuracy elapsedTime is
        a double and therefore needs to be cast down to a float to match the PointF structure)</p>
    <div class="codeblock">
        <div style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Courier New">
            <pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: green">//Move the sprite based on the velocity</span></pre>
            <pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp; &nbsp; Location.X += Velocity.X * (<span style="color: blue">float</span>)elapsedTime;</pre>
            <pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp; &nbsp; Location.Y += Velocity.Y * (<span style="color: blue">float</span>)elapsedTime;</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The loop timings I mentioned here are very exaggerated - on most computers the loop
        will be running hundreds or thousands of times per second meaning that your animations
        will be very smooth and accurate.</p>
    <h3>
        Sprite bounds</h3>
    <p>
        There are 2 ways to represent the rectangle containing the sprite:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>X, Y, Height, Width</li>
        <li>X, Y of top left corner and X, Y of bottom right corner</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Whilst both of these are valid you most usually find the first one in use. Its easier
        to just update one corner as the sprite moves around and calculate the other corner
        when its needed. For tasks like collisions and bounds checking you need to calculate
        the bottom right corner so you will see X+Width and Y+Height as a very commonly
        used formula in games.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Simple Collision Detection</h3>
    <p>
        Collisions are a vital part of almost any game - they restrict where an object can
        move, whether an object has taken damage and so forth.</p>
    <p>
        Simple collisions can be described in terms of the positions and
        size of the sprites and the regions they need to collide with. Since everything
        is rectangular in this case there is no need for any more complex collisions that
        need to be determined at the pixel level. All the collisions can be checked for
        by just seeing if the rectangles overlap or if the coordinates are outside of a
        certain range. Checking for rectangle overlap is <a href="http://www.tekpool.com/?p=23">
            quite simple</a>.</p>
    <div class="codeblock">
        <div style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Courier New">
            <pre style="margin: 0px"><span style="color: blue">private</span> <span style="color: blue">bool</span> collide(<span
    style="color: teal"></span>)</pre>
            <pre style="margin: 0px">{</pre>
            <pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: blue">return</span> ! ( sprite1.Location.X                       &gt; sprite2.Location.X + sprite2.Size.Width</pre>
            <pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || sprite1.Location.X + sprite1.Size.Width  &lt; sprite2.Location.X</pre>
            <pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || sprite1.Location.Y                       &gt; sprite2.Location.Y + sprite2.Size.Height</pre>
            <pre style="margin: 0px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || sprite1.Location.Y + sprite1.Size.Height &lt; sprite2.Location.Y);</pre>
            <pre style="margin: 0px">}</pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        This code uses an efficient algorithm for determining if the 2 rectangles overlap.
        It checks the bounds of both rectangles to determine if they DON'T overlap and then
        negates the result. For example the first line checks if the left hand edge of sprite
        1 is to the right of the right hand edge of sprite 2. If it is then obviously they
        cannot overlap. The next 3 lines check the other 3 edges.</p>
